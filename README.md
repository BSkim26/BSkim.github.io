### Title
    Online Visualization tool

### Table of Contents
- index.html
  - NEW MODEL
    - Create the ANN.html
    
          From simple ANNs to MLPs, you can create them by adjusting the number of layers and nodes.
          
    - 2D_to_1D.html
    
          Each pixel of the 2D input is represented as a node and arranged vertically, as shown in the image.
          
    - Feature_map.html
    
          Expresses the action of connecting a 2D image to a node using a filter. 
          
          The behavior has been configured so that you can observe how the filter behaves when the images are aligned.
          
    - Flat_View.html
    
          Expresses the action of connecting the 2D image to the node using a filter.
          
          This is what it looks like when features are extracted from CNNs and connected to the Fully Connected Layers (FCL).
          
    - Crate the CNN.html
    
          Demonstrates how CNNs work from start to finish.
          
  - EXISTING MODEL
    
        No features have been added yet.

### Install
    This document does not require any installation.

### Usage
    You can access these features at the following address:
    https://bskim26.github.io/BSkim.github.io

    Upon accessing the website, you will be redirected to the index.html page. 
    From there, you can click the "New Model" button to create your desired Neural Network. 
    The first feature is creating Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Up to 3000 edges can be configured, and there is no limit to the number of layers. 
    The second feature is creating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The structure of CNNs is fixed, and the user can observe specific parts in detail. 
    By clicking the button under the part you want to see in detail and entering the desired variable value, an appropriate illustration will be automatically generated.
